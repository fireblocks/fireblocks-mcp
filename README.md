[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40fireblocks%2Fmcp-server.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40fireblocks%2Fmcp-server)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for the Fireblocks API, enabling AI assistants to interact with Fireblocks services through a standardized protocol.

## Overview

This MCP server provides secure access to Fireblocks functionality, allowing AI assistants to:

- Query and create transactions
- Retrieve and manage vault accounts and assets
- Access exchange account information
- Query network connections and policies
- Query blockchain information and whitelisted IP addresses
- Query external and internal wallets
- Query and filter workspace users

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm or yarn

## Installation

### Step 1: Create an API key

To get started, you'll need a **Fireblocks API Key** and its corresponding **secret key file**.

1. Follow the [Fireblocks guide on creating an API key](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407823826194-Adding-new-API-Users).

üîí *Security Note: When configuring an API user for the MCP server, it is critical to grant only the minimum permissions required for its specific tasks. For example, for read-only tasks like viewing transaction history, the "Viewer" role is the most secure option. For a detailed guide on user roles, please refer to the [best practices for choosing user roles](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/5254222799900-Best-practices-for-choosing-user-roles)*.

2. Once created, securely store both the API Key and the secret key file (e.g., `fireblocks-secret.key`). You will need both for the next steps.

### Step 2: Configure your MCP Client

#### For Claude Desktop

1. Open **Claude Desktop**.
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Edit Config** to open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
3. Add a new server with this configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fireblocks": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fireblocks/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "FIREBLOCKS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "your-fireblocks-api-secret-key-filepath",
        "ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Cursor

1. Open **Cursor**.
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Cursor Settings ‚Üí Tools & Integrations**.
3. Select **MCP Tools** and click **Add Custom MCP** to open the `mcp.json` file.
4. Add a new server with this configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fireblocks": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@fireblocks/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FIREBLOCKS_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "FIREBLOCKS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "your-api-secret-key-filepath",
        "ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Customize MCP Server Settings (Optional)
* To enable write operations, set the `ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS` environment variable to `true`. Be sure to read the **Security Considerations** section before doing so.
* If you need to use a **non-default Fireblocks environment** (e.g., Non-US, Sandbox), you must add the `FIREBLOCKS_API_BASE_URL` setting. Set its value to the base URL of the specific environment's API.

## Prompt Examples

Here are some example prompts you can use with the Fireblocks MCP server:

```
Show me all my vault accounts and their balances
```

```
Get the last 10 transactions from today
```

```
What is my total Bitcoin balance across all accounts?
```

```
Top up my Bitstamp account to have 1000 USDC or USDT
```

```
Why did the policy block my last transaction?
```

**Note:** Transaction creation and top-up examples require `ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=true` and appropriate permissions.

## Security Considerations

The use of an AI assistant to interact with your Fireblocks workspace presents inherent risks. Since AI models may produce unintended results, it is imperative to implement a robust security strategy to safeguard your assets. The following practices are highly recommended:


### Default Safe Configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning**: Write operations, such as creating transactions and modifying data in your Fireblocks workspace, are enabled by an AI assistant. For enhanced security, these operations (e.g., `create_transaction`) are disabled by default. They can be enabled by explicitly setting the `ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS` environment variable to `true`. This should only be done in trusted environments with appropriate access controls.

### Principle of Least Privilege

When configuring an API user for the MCP server, it is essential to grant only the minimum permissions necessary for its intended function. For read-only tasks, a "Viewer" role, which is restricted to viewing transaction history, is the most secure option.

For a detailed guide on user roles, please refer to the [the best practices for choosing user roles](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/5254222799900-Best-practices-for-choosing-user-roles).

Instructions for creating a new API user can be found in the [Fireblocks guide on creating an API key](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/4407823826194-Adding-new-API-Users).

### Human in the Loop

We strongly advise utilizing the Fireblocks Policy Engine to ensure human oversight in the transaction approval process. A policy can be configured to require a manual designated signer to approve any transaction initiated by the AI assistant. More information can be found [here](https://support.fireblocks.io/hc/en-us/articles/7365877039004-Rule-parameters).

### Secure API Credentials

Your Fireblocks API Key and Private Key are highly sensitive credentials. Adherence to these best practices is mandatory:

- API credentials must never be shared publicly.
- The private key should be stored securely, preferably as a file with restricted access, as specified in the Configuration section.
